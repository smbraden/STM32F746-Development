# STM32F746 Development
 Collection of educational register-access examples developed with Keil MDK for an STM32F746ZGTXX. Use of ST's HAL might be explored in future projects for more complex drivers. However, the chief aim is to practice size efficiency by implementing direct register access and avoiding hardware abstraction layers with significant overhead.
