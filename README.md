# STM32F746 Development
 Collection of educational CMSIS examples developed with Keil MDK for an STM32F746ZGTXX. Use of ST's HAL might be explored in future projects--in particular, for protoyping more complex drivers. However, the chief aim is to practice size efficiency via direct register access, while avoiding hardware abstraction layers with significant overhead.
